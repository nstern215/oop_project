In this project we recreated the game of "Save The King".
The code was writen with a combination of libraries including SFML in order to give the game 
more of color.
This version of the game included more elements like the game being timed, dwarfs moving on the board.
(+-*).

The logic tries to use less memory as possible combined with the best time complexity

4.
The different objects in this project are mainly the characters and the board_items.
Being that the characters are representing the objects that can move on the map, and the board_items
representing the items on the map that cannot move but yet have an effect on the ongoing of the game.
 

5.
The file being used to load the levels is actually a file holding the names of other files that each of those
files holds a map of the upcoming level.
The reason for this format is to simplify the load of each level for each level is indivedual and not part
of one very long file.
